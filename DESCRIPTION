Description: A 'shiny' app that supports both dual and bulk RNA-seq, with the dual
    RNA-seq functionality offering the flexibility to perform either a
    sequential approach (where reads are mapped separately to each genome)
    or a combined approach (where reads are aligned to a single merged
    genome). The user-friendly interface automates the analysis process,
    providing step-by-step guidance, making it easy for users to navigate
    between different analysis steps, and download intermediate results
    and publication-ready plots.
