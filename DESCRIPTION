Description: inDAGO supports both dual and bulk RNA-seq, with the dual
    RNA-seq functionality offering the flexibility to perform either a
    sequential approach (where reads are mapped separately to each genome)
    or a combined approach (where reads are aligned to a single merged
    genome). The user-friendly interface automates the analysis process,
    providing step-by-step guidance, making it easy for users to navigate
    between different analysis steps, and download intermediate re-sults
    and publication-ready plots. Thanks to code optimization and
    parallelization in inDAGO, dual and bulk RNA-seq analyses can be
    completed in a reasonable time without requiring ex-pensive
    computational resources, just using a standard laptop with 16 GB of
    RAM. inDAGO is organized into modules that handle key tasks, including
    sequence pre-processing with quality control, reference-based sequence
    alignment, read count summarization, explora-tory data analysis, and
    the identification of differentially expressed genes or transcripts
    across selected comparisons.
