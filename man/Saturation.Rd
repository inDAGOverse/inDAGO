\usage{
Saturation(matrix, method, max_reads, palette)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix}{Numeric matrix or object coercible to matrix (genes × samples), e.g., log-counts or raw counts.
Genes are rows; samples are columns.}

\item{method}{Character. Estimation method: "division" or "sampling".}

\item{max_reads}{Numeric. Maximum number of reads to include in the rarefaction (default: Inf).}

\item{palette}{Character. Name of a discrete color palette from the  "paletteer " package for curve colors.}
}
\value{
A  "ggplot " object showing saturation (genes detected) versus sequencing depth for each sample.
}
\description{
Generate a saturation curve plot showing gene detection versus sequencing depth.
}
\details{
This function estimates how many genes are detected at increasing read depths using
a rarefaction-based approach ( "estimate_saturation() from RNAseQC"), and plots the
saturation curves for each sample. It supports two estimation methods: “division”
for a fast analytic approximation and “sampling” for more realistic approach.
\enumerate{
\item Internally,  "extract_counts() " (from countSubsetNorm) extracts a counts matrix from
various input classes (matrix, DGEList, EList, ExpressionSet).
\item "estimate_saturation() " (from RNAseQC) rarefies each library at multiple depths:
}
\itemize{
\item “division” divides counts by scale factors;
\item “sampling” performs repeated random sampling to simulate read down sampling.
}
\enumerate{
\item The resulting data frame contains one row per sample per depth, with the number of
detected genes ( "sat ") and, for sampling, its variance ( "sat.var ").
\item The function then plots gene saturation curves ( "sat" vs.  "depth") colored by sample.
