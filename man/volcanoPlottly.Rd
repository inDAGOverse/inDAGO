volcanoPlottly(
  x,
  palettePoint,
  Th_logFC,
  Th_Pvalue,
  subsetGenes,
  st_significance
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Character. File path to a CSV containing DEG results, with at least columns "ID", "logFC", and one of "PValue", "FDR", or "FWER".}

\item{palettePoint}{Character. Name of a discrete palette from the "paletteer" package, supplying colors for "UP", "DOWN", and "NO".}

\item{Th_logFC}{Numeric. Absolute logâ‚‚ fold-change threshold to call a gene "UP" or "DOWN".}

\item{Th_Pvalue}{Numeric. P-value threshold to call significance (uses "FDR"/"FWER" if "st_significance = "adjustPvalue"", otherwise raw "PValue").}

\item{subsetGenes}{Integer or "Inf". If numeric, only the top "subsetGenes" genes by p-value are included in the plot.}

\item{st_significance}{Character. Which p-value column to use: "adjustPvalue" (FDR or FWER) or "PValue".}
}
\value{
A Plotly object ("plotly::ggplotly") representing the interactive volcano plot.
}
\description{
Create an interactive volcano plot of differential expression results using "Plotly".
}
\details{
This function reads a CSV of DEGs, classifies genes as up/down/no change based on
log-fold change and p-value thresholds, and renders an interactive volcano plot
via "plotly::ggplotly()".
\enumerate{
\item Reads the input CSV and checks for duplicate IDs.
\item Standardizes columns to "ID", "logFC", and "adjustPvalue" or "PValue".
\item Optionally subsets to the top N genes by p-value.
\item Classifies each gene as "UP", "DOWN", or "NO" based on thresholds.
\item Plots points with manual fill, size, and alpha scales, adds threshold lines,
and converts to an interactive Plotly graph.
